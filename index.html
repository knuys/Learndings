        <h1>CodeAcademy: Make A Website</h1>

        <h2>Getting Started With HTML</h2>
        <p>This module is all about the initial basic skills for HTML learned through CodeAcademy's "Make A Website"
            lesson. So far I have made headings of varying sizes using 'h1' and 'h2', and am currently using 'p' to
            write
            this paragraph.</p>

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>Now I am under an 'h3', pretty neat, huh? Still using 'p' for making this text. Now I am going to use 'a
            href' with the necessary quotation marks to link to one of my
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TDyceWAhBI">favourite videos on youtube</a>. I remembered to use
            my greater-than symbol to include that text in my link, and I closed it with the /a which is why this text
            is
            not part of the link!</p>

        <p>I have made a new paragraph using 'p' directly under my previous one and it has created a space, like a
            real paragraph should on Word Doc. I just ran this by saving the file as HTML and it is not pretty, but it
            is doing the things I want it to for now.</p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>Now I will insert an image of one of my favourite animals.</p>
        <img width="600" style="display:block; margin:auto; border:thick dotted darkseagreen; padding: 1rem"
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583812365991-05f45d8a765e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2255&q=80"/>

        <p>Back with another 'p'. To do add this image I used 'img src' with the equals sign and the quotation marks
            as I did with 'a href'. To close, this just needed a forward slash and a greater-than symbol. The image is
            also huge, I will find my own way to address this as it is not covered in this lesson.</p>

        <p>I have now learned how to change the size of my image by adding the 'width' attribute before 'src'.</p>

        <h3>Videos</h3>
        <p>Now I am inserting a video. This is different to when I inserted a video link. This will actually embed
            a player onto this page. Unfortunately, I had to diverge away from the method proposed by CodeAcademy as I
            could not find a way to get a link to the mp4 of a video online without getting distracted, so instead I
            hit the embed option for sharing on YouTube which, to be fair, most people are likely to do anyway when
            embedding videos. </p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWYeoXGkYFU" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen
            style="display: block; margin:auto; border:thick dotted darkseagreen; padding: 1rem;"></iframe>

        <p>It works well, YouTube also has the option to add components which will 'Enhance Privacy' for those on my
            site, but since I will likely be the only person using this, my soul has already been sold to the YouTube
            overlords.

            The CodeAcademy 'Way of Doing Things TM' would be to use 'video' element with 'width' and 'height'
            attributes
            at a 320:240 ratio, and the addition of the 'controls' attribute. This is followed by a 'source' element and
            an 'src' attribute to insert the direct video link. You then specify the video type with the attribute
            'type'
            and hope for the best you've embedded yourself a video.

            However, I am sure you can do the same with audio.</p>

        <audio controls>
            <source src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qt2ais164za4ygb/K-391%20-%20Earth.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio>

        <p>It works, but it will not play as the link is not a 'pure' file. Let me try with one below with an 'ogg'
            from Wikipedia:</p>

        <audio controls>
            <source
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Chopin_Prelude_Op_28_N_15_Giorgi_Latsabidze_performs.ogg"
                type="audio/ogg">
        </audio>

        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>Now we are doing lists. First, I am going to make an unordered list using the 'ul' tag like so:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Now I have used a 'li' tag to make a point</li>
            <li>I closed that one and made another 'li' tag for a new point</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Something Extra</h4>

        <p>I want to try making a numbered list as if I were say, writing a recipe's method, or step-by-step on how
            to even do this. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>First, stop thinking about making yourself an unordered list, a numbered list is technically an
                ordered list, right?</li>
            <li>So instead of using 'ul', use 'ol' making this an ordered list</li>
            <li>All of the points continue to be created using and closing 'li' per point</li>
            <li>Enjoy finding this neat</li>
        </ol>

        <p>CodeAcademy is now taking the time to discuss parent vs child elements, I have taken it to mean that child
            elements should have parent elements, but parent elements don't need children unless you want them to look
            useful...ouch. The example they gave was very well illustrated:
        </p>

        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/make-a-website/img/parent-child.svg" alt="Chart 
        showing 'ul' as the parent element and 'il' as the child element" style="background-color: rgb(24, 24, 68)" />

        <p>To this image I went and sought out a way to label my image such that low vision/blind people or those
            with screenreaders would be included. As it is an SVG file, I could not crop the image, however I did get
            some very good practice with using inline and internal styles. Not fun.</p>

        <h3>What the Div?</h3>

        <p>From what it says about the 'div' element, it sounds like 'div' basically allows me to divide up my page
            into neat containers that I can then treat independently away from the rest of the page. Below I am making a
            'div' which can later
            be used as a nav (I decide not to do make it a nav, but I kept it regardless as I go back to this for future
            examples)</p>

        <h4>Div Practice Navigation</h4>
        <div class="nav">
            <ol>
                <li>Links</li>
                <li>Images </li>
                <li>Video</li>
                <li>Lists</li>
                <li>Div</li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="selector">
            <h3>CSS Class Selectors.</h3>
            <p>I made this text pink by creating a 'div' in HTML and using the class selector in
                my CSS file.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We have revisted the 'div' in the CSS module of this lesson. It specifies that
            when we name our 'div's we are essentially creating a type of container for everything in that div. We
            can then use that name, which is called a 'class selector' to apply CSS to this container by using
            '.class selector name' in your CSS.</p>


        <h3>Metadata</h3>

        <p>This is the part of the lesson where CodeAcademy finally explains all the elements I have no clue about
            which I copy-pasted straight into my text editor. Here is a summary of them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>'!DOCTYPE html' - This tells the browser to expect some poorly written HTML and which version. Without
                it, things may go whack as it may use older standards for rendering the site.</li>
            <li>'html'- Daddy</li>
            <li>'head' - This precedes the title, it encloses all of the metadata</li>
            <li>'title' - What you call your site, and the name that appears on a search result for example</li>
            <li> 'meta charset="utf-8"' - Tells the browser what character sets to use, the utf-8 is the character set
                chosen. I'm sure when I mess around with it, it will be clearer to me.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Closing Comments</h3>

        <p>Unfortunately, as I am not interested in forking money over to CodeAcademy, I won't be able to access the
            Freeform Project or the Multiple Choice Quiz. But I think making this diary for my learning is a good way to
            actually learn and have a project of my own.</p>

        <p>What I would like to improve on would of course be styling. This thing is hideous! I am also upset that it
            didn't expand on some of the concepts such as teaching me how to resize images. It's also a bit of a shame
            that I could not get the audio or video embeddings to work, or that it had not taught me how to make
            clickable links to bring users to a specific location on the page. Perhaps future lessons will expand on
            that.
        </p>




        <h2>Styling with CSS</h2>

        <p>I don't fully understand what differs between CSS and html, I'm imagining it as the difference between 'skin'
            vs 'central nervous system' - both are important, but without skin it's kinda gross.</p>

        <p>CodeAcademy has me starting off with familiarising myself with the 'link' element. This element allows CSS
            styling to be used. It basically interacts with my html and jazzes up the place. It's also a self-closing
            tag
            just like the 'img' element. Link uses the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>'rel' - What the relationship between the current file and the file being linked to is</li>
            <li>'type' - What type of file is being linked to</li>
            <li>'href' - Where the link goes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To do this right, we need to include all of those attributes in our 'link' element. For the purposes of
            learning, I have followed the CodeAcademy method and made 'rel' be 'stylesheet', 'type' be 'text/css', and
            'href' be 'main.css' as was in the example. This is External CSS and requires that I have a 'main.css' file
            for it to take my styling from. I will do that now.</p>

        <p>After messing around a bit making my CSS file, which honestly wasn't that tricky, I realised my colour
            theory palate cannot be satisfied just yet until I learn more styling techniques which would allow me to
            pick colours that really pop in certain areas. For now, all I've done was play with font size, background
            colour and margins for my headings. I'm restricting myself to play around just withwhat I am being taught
            ...mostly. I did use W3 Schools to help me out with the CSS file because it was paining me that it wasn't
            yet included in the lesson.</p>

        <p>I can also add an Internal Stylesheet if I wanted to using the 'style' element and CSS rules as I did with
            h5. </p>
        <h5>I changed the font colour. The only difference between doing this and an external CSS is that this
            required the 'style' element and no link element!</h5>
        <p> We can also add inline styles and create something funky with style becoming an attribute.</p>

        <p style="color: blue; 
        font-size: 20px; 
        font-style: italic;
        margin-bottom: 30px;
        ">Similar to the previous example, however this is applied only to this text. I also need to remember to
            add my greater-than before my string! Here I changed the font size, style and colour. As you can see, it has
            taken the margin style from the external CSS. I also used this inline styling to add a background color
            to a transparent image above.</p>

        <h3>Rule Anatomy</h3>
        <p>It's that part of the lesson which is all about reading. Here is some fresh CSS vocab:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Rule - A list of CSS instructions you use to style your HTML</li>
            <li>Selector - The HTML element you wish to beautify with CSS</li>
            <li>Property - What type of beautification will occur such as colour</li>
            <li>Value - The specific lipstick you have chosen</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/7a/82/5d7a82064300f646c963998ebb22ff70.gif" alt="Info-graphic
        showing what a rule, selector, property and value looks like when written up in code"
            style="display:block; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto">

        <p>To center this image I had to adjust the inline style where left and right margins were set to auto
            and I used the 'display' property with 'block' value.</p>

        <h3>Editing the CSS</h3>
        <p>Now I am moving into adding new properties to my CSS file, these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Font Family - Choosing which font I use for each of my selectors</li>
            <li>Color - This includes hexidecimal and rgb colours</li>
            <li>Font Size - This takes 'px' (pixel), rem (elements are scalable in proportion to each other across
                screen sizes) and em (size scales relative to a parent) as values. For knowing which one to use when,
                <a href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/when-should-i-use-px-vs-rem-vs-em/358152">this page should
                    help</a>.</li>
            <li>Background Image - Allows you to put in a background image for a given selector</li>
            <li>Background Size - Adjust the background size, especially for images such as with zooming</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="new">
            <h4 style="margin-top: 30px; text-align: center; font-size: 5rem;">&sung; A Whole New Div &sung; </h4>
            <p style="justify-content: center;">Here we are, adding in a background image by using the background-image
                property in the CSS file.</p>

            <p style="justify-content: center;">I have also used the background-size property to try make it more
                aesthetically pleasing. I also
                increased the font size with 'rem' in my CSS file.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; border: 1rem solid magenta; padding: 2em; font-size: 2em;">GRAPHIC DESIGN IS
                MY
                PASSION</p>
        </div>

        <h3>CSS ID Selectors</h3>

        <p>Class selectors which we did just previously, allow us to beautify HTML elements of specific classes.
            'Anchor elements' allow us to style individual elements uniquely and let other elements go unharmed.
            This takes an element like 'p' with 'id' as the attribute. An ID attribute can only be used once because
            it is unique to the element it is assigned to. If there is a CSS rule for a class attribute, the id
            attribute will over-rule it. To create a rule for an attribute in CSS you use a '#' instead of a '.'
            If unsure between using 'id' or 'class' selectors, <a
                href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/when-should-i-use-id-selectors-vs-class-selectors/358157">this
                page
                may be helpful</a>.</p>

        <h2>Boundaries and Space</h2>
        <p>This is all about organising a webpage using the 'Box Model' for aesthetic reasons. Essentially it's
            boxes in boxes in boxes, with each box centered within the previous and works inward in order like this:
            <ol>
                <li>Margin - First box set with the 'margin' property; white space between elements</li>
                <li>Border - 2nd box set with the 'border property; an outline</li>
                <li>Padding - 3rd box - gives extra space between the content and the border</li>
                <li>Content - Text, images, media etc</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Borders</h3>

        <p>Not really sure why they didn't just include this in the 'Styling CSS' component, but okay. I am working
            on borders now. It's basically a picture-frame around content. A 'border' property takes 3 values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thickness - Self-explanatory. It takes rem, em and px.</li>
            <li>Type - Border style which may be solid, dotted or dashed.</li>
            <li>Color - Again, using, named, HEX or RGB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also change these individually using the properties 'border-style', 'border-color' and
            'border-width'.
            Originally, I was using the 'margin-left' etc properties to set a border around page, but I will now
            use the border property.
        </p>

        <h3>Padding</h3>

        <p>Padding is a great way to avoid adding margins to just about everything. It's basically the space
            between an element's content and its border. Increasing the white space improves readability. Just
            like 'margin', you can also individually alter each side of padding using padding-left, right, etc,
            or you can input 4 values (one for each side) in the 'padding' property going from left to right,
            the order is top, right, bottom, left (clockwise).
        </p>
        <p>I have now added padding to my paragraphs and it has caused a bit of mayhem and uneveness which
            hopefully I can resolve.
        </p>
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>The class is now going into detail about margins, however I have already set my margins using 'margin'
            in the 'body' selector of my CSS file. I've also played with it in inline styling for images and used
            the top and bottom margins for headings. This sets the amount of space between html elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding Display</h3>
        <p>Display types allow us to change the layout of our HTML elements on a page. There are two main ones:
            Block and Inline, illustrated below where block shows a top-down configuration with each element given
            its own line on the webpage - this leads to more white-space. Inline configuration takes up the empty
            space. If deciding between inline or block styles, <a
                href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/which-commonly-used-elements-are-display-block-which-are-display-inline/361264">this
                resource may be helpful</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/make-a-website/img/block-inline.svg"
            style="background-color: rgb(24, 24, 68)" />


        <h3>Inline</h3>
        <p>When using the 'display' property we can overwrite a number of display types. It took me some time
            to wrap my head around it, but I went back up to the Nav practice area and used '.nav li' as a selector
            to make it display the list in a line. I added padding so they didn't look so squished. Basically, this
            arranges html elements on the same line as neighbouring ones.
        </p>

        <h3>Float</h3>

        <p>The 'float' property allows us to have elements which 'float' to the left or right within a line
            (not put into its own line) of neibouring html elements. I have used float right at the bottom of
            the page. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the technicalities of 'float' so I'll just
            <a
                href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/does-the-float-property-affect-inline-elements-differently-than-block-elements/361265">stick
                this resource here</a>
            .</p>

        <h3>Flex</h3>

        <p>Josh has asked me to explain <a
                href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/why-use-display-flex/361266">'flex'</a> to
            him when I am done. Unsure if I will do a good job, but
            I'll try! So far I know it's a value of display and Flex apparently can be used to easily set
            multiple alignments on the page horizontally or vertically. To prevent child elements moving
            off the page we can use 'flex-wrap' with value 'wrap'...Okay! Let's have a go. :)
        </p>

                height="300px">
        </div>
        <p>Here I did a number of things:
            <ul>
                <li>I created a 'div' called 'food'</li>
                <li>I adjusted the height of all images with inline styling to make them more harmonious</li>
                <li>I used my 'food' selector to display inline, then display flex for horizontal display</li>
                <li>Then I added the 'flex-wrap' so it stays within the page confines and 'justify-content' to
                    center it all.</li>
                <li>Lastly, I used the 'food img' selector to add padding around my images on the right and bottom</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To flex vertically, <a
                href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/how-do-we-use-flexbox-display-flex-to-align-elements-vertically/361270">this
                explains it really well</a>.</p>

        <h3>Position</h3>

        <p>The final lesson here is all about the 'position' property in CSS which allows us to place our html elements
            into precise locations we want them to be. We can use the value 'relative' to position page elements on a
            webpage relative to where they would normally appear. By first setting position: relative, you
            can then use the CSS properties top, left, bottom, and right to shift an element away from where
            it would have normally appeared on the page. We can even use 'position' to create 'clickable buttons'.
        </p>

        <div class="button"><a href="">Click Me!</a></div>

        <p>To do this, I needed to have 3 selectors:
            <ol>
                <li>Button - To manipulate margins</li>
                <li>Button a - To create a border, padding, position and cursor properties</li>
                <li>Button a:active - To create the click bounce movement thing using the 'top' property with a px value
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Other position values which use properties like top, right, left and bottom include:
            <ul>
                <li>Position:Absolute - positioned in relation to the nearest positioned parent element. If no
                    positioned
                    parent element, the element is positioned in relation to the html element</li>
                <li>Position:Fixed - the element is fixed in position and won't move even when scrolling</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>It makes making stuff faster and better. This includes the following elements:
            <ul>
                <li>Header - for webpage headers</li>
                <li>Footer - for webpage footers</li>
                <li>Section - to define webpage sections</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To use Bootstrap, we will need to link to it similar to how we linked to CSS. So I did that and it made my
            flex-wrap prettier.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons people like Bootstrap is because of it's grid layout system which makes it quick and
            reliable
            to create page
            layouts and organise html elements into the preconfigured columns. You don't have to use the grid to enjoy
            other
            Bootstrap features
            like dropdown menus, buttons, jumbotrons. The grid is like this:
        </p>

        <h3>Headers and Navigation</h3>

        <p>Now we are using Bootstrap to create a header with a navbar (finally!). To do this, I:
            <ol>
                <li>Created a header element with Bootstrap's 'container' class below the body</li>
                <li>Create a div child in header with Bootstrap class 'row'</li>
                <li>Create a nav element directly under that with Bootstrap class 'col-sm-8 text-right'</li>
                <li>This nav now has 'p' elements denoting what goes in the nav bar</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Jumbotrons</h3>

        <p>Basically an area that shows the important stuff. The 'jumbotron' class takes a 'section' element. A div with
            container class is
            put within it. Here I will use a jumbotron to put in some choice info about this page.
        </p>

        <section class="jumbotron">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row text-center">
                    <h2>Modern Home Design</h2>
                    <h3>Contemporary Architecture For Home Renovation</h3>
                    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.saota.com/" role="button">Get Inspired</a>
                </div>
        </section>

        <p id="anchoring">&copy; Bae Practise Blog</p>

        <p>Above I used 'id' attribute on a paragraph and added a copyright logo using the ampersand. I then edited the
            CSS
            file
            with a '#' before my 'id' selector. I did this because I liked how my jumbotron turned out and I hadn't yet
            used
            'id'.
        </p>

        <h3>Supporting Content</h3>
        <p>We can arrange supporting content using Bootstrap's grid system. For this, we will divide some 'row' classes'
            with 'col-sm..'
            and insert 'figure' elements. Note: Bootstrap columns range from 1-12.
        </p>

        <section class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <figure class="col-sm-5">
                    <p>Kitchen</p>
                    <img width="450px"
                        src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556912167-f556f1f39fdf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1960&q=80" />
                </figure>
                <figure class="col-sm-1"><p></p></figure>
                <figure class="col-sm-5">
                    <p>Living</p>
                    <img width="450px"
                        src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574422886984-fd67cddac094?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" />
                </figure>
            </div>
        </section>

        <h3>Footers</h3>

        <p>We have now come to the last lesson of 'Make a Website'. Footers are normally used to show copyright
            information, social media links,
            and sometimes, site navigation. Today, I'm using it to for a social media and lesson link. I know it's not
            the best location for it but I needed to put something in it and that something is this for now.</p>

        <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
        <p>I've made a webpage all by myself! I can actually say all of the html and css was written by me. There are a
            few
            things which
            bother me that I don't quite have the skills right now to fix the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cropping and recolouring images</li>
            <li>Moving my audio players</li>
            <li>Having a page nav bar that directs to specific sections of the page</li>
            <li>Adjusting borders to appear only around some text and not a whole line</li>
            <li>Moving the social media buttons up and down vertically to appear more central in the footer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, those skills should come in the 'Learn HTML' and 'Learn CSS' lessons. I just did this one because
            it seemed like a good intro to them both - and it was! I'm pretty happy with how this page looks and I'm happy with the things
            I've used and techniques
            I have implemented. It honestly looks like a decent page - which is fairly easy if you don't use Papyrus script and textured backgrounds.

            Let's hope my next attempt at learning new computer-ry skills will be just as successful.
