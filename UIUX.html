        <h1>UI/UX Design</h1>
        <h2>What is UI and UX Design</h2>
        <p>It becomes difficult to unpick where UI ends for UX to start, and vice versa. It doesn't help that there is
            poor industry understanding of these terms, with many job adverts either using the term 'UI/UX designer' or
            asking for a UX designer, but are describing a UI design role. These terms get confused very often and
            thrown around to mean the same thing, but there is a difference. UI design is concerned with the user
            interface product, whereas UX design is concerned with what the users will take from the experience of using
            the product. Often, however, these roles do become collapsed into UI/UX, particularly in smaller companies
            where UI designers have to also be responsible for the UX side of things.
        </p>
        <p>There are four main principles to master when it comes to good UI/UX design:
            <ul>
                <li>Good Colour Schemes</li>
                <li>Good Typography</li>
                <li>Good Layout, Spacing and Grids</li>
                <li>Design Tools such as Photoshop XD</li>
            
            </ul>
            UX principles:
            <ul>
                <li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
                <li>UX Design Process</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
