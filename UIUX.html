        <h1>UI/UX Design</h1>
        <h2>What is UI and UX Design</h2>
        <p>It becomes difficult to unpick where UI ends for UX to start, and vice versa. It doesn't help that there is
            poor industry understanding of these terms, with many job adverts either using the term 'UI/UX designer' or
            asking for a UX designer, but are describing a UI design role. These terms get confused very often and
            thrown around to mean the same thing, but there is a difference. UI design is concerned with the user
            interface product, whereas UX design is concerned with what the users will take from the experience of using
            the product. Often, however, these roles do become collapsed into UI/UX, particularly in smaller companies
            where UI designers have to also be responsible for the UX side of things.
        </p>
        <p>There are four main principles to master when it comes to good UI/UX design:
        <ul>
            <li>Good Colour Schemes</li>
            <li>Good Typography</li>
            <li>Good Layout, Spacing and Grids</li>
            <li>Design Tools such as Photoshop XD</li>

        </ul>
        UX principles:
        <ul>
            <li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
            <li>UX Design Process</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What's the difference?</h3>
        <p>UI designers are primarily focussed on developing and making the visual themes (fonts, colours, icons etc)
            and 'page furniture'. A UX designer looks at all at that, but also the brief and building and testing for
            the desired user base. A product designer is similar to a UX designer however with greater managerial roles
            such as working directly with engineering teams, stakeholders, clients etc</p>
        <h3>What is a design brief?</h3>
        <p>The design brief includes all vital details that the client, you or you and the client agree upon are to be
            included in the project. A design brief should include:
        <ul>
            <li>Project name</li>
            <li>Project description</li>
            <li>The persona/Who it is designed for</li>
            <li>Feature list/Product requirements to input to the wireframe</li>
            <li>Competitors and Product inspo</li>
            <li>Deliverables - What we will do and what we will not do</li>
            <li>Costs - base cost and then cost for additional hours, upfront payment etc</li>
            <li>Timeline/Deadline</li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
        <p>For determining size of webpage for scrollable elements/margins. Head to <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp">W3 Schools</a> to find the most commonly
            used aspect ratios. If you are not sure which ratio to use, ask your client for their Google Analytics so
            you may check what their audience uses be it screen resolution, browser, device or mobile vs desktop usage.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Point text - great for headings. Achieved by just clicking on a spot on the page and runs to the end of
                the page</li>
            <li>Area text - point-click and drag into a box shape. You can convert point text and area text into each
                other by adjusting it in the 'Text' module on the right hand column.</li>
        </ul>
