        <h3>New Elements and Attributes</h3>
        <p>While I am revisiting old concepts which may be viewed on my <a href="./index.html">Codecademy: Make A
                Website</a> page, I am also
            introduced to a few new HTML elements, attributes and types. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Anchors - element; finally I can create internal links to different sections of my webpage which can
                    be
                    observed on this page. To do this, I created an anchor using the 'a' element, which the 'href' then
                    takes a # with an 'id' attribute which is assigned to an element I wish to link to. You can also
                    create 'dead links' using just the # symbol, this is useful when modifying the link in Javascript,
                    or as a placeholder if the link is yet unknown. You can also use dead links to turn an image into a
                    clickable link, by nesting the image in the dead anchor.
                </li>
                <li>target="_blank" - this attribute/value coupling can be used to open links in a fresh tab.</li>
                <li>input - a self-closing element that allows me to get input from a user. I can select a type of input
                    accepted by it aswell such as text</li>
                <li>Placeholder - attribute; placeholder text is what sits in the input box before the user has put
                    anything in.</li>
                <li>Form - element; allows you to build webform and submit input data to a server. To do so, use the
                    'action' attribute.</li>
                <li>Button - self-explanatory element; this also takes a 'type' and text.</li>
                <li>Required - attribute; can be given to 'input' so inputs are...well..required to progress in a form
                    for example.</li>
                <li>Label - element; nesting elements within it, will associate them with the label element and can lead
                    to cool things like clickable associated text for radio buttons. In this case, it is always good
                    practice to give your labels a 'for' attribute whose label matches with the input 'id' attribute.
                    Each label in a set should share the same 'name' attribute value in the input element to create a
                    radio group.</li>
                <li>Radio buttons - 'type' value of 'input'. Basically multiple-choice buttons. Below I included ones
                    with and without 'label'.</li>
                <li>Checkboxes - a type of input. It is best practice to match your label 'for' and input 'id' values.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--Make own box example for margins, padding and borders relative to 2 html elements, show that setting a negative margin makes the element larger-->
        <p>We also touch on creating ordered and unordered lists, which I love using. The example on Free Code Camp was
            to create lists on what cats love and hate. I decided to use my favourite image of a cat displaying the
            'hatred' emotion state to utilise the 'dead linking' I mentioned earlier.</p>

            </label>
        </form>
        <h2 id="CSS-section" class="orange-text">Basic CSS</h2>
        <p>Again, a lot of this is a refresh of old concepts such as setting fonts, changing colours, padding and
            margins, however there are a few new tricks as well. Here are some new attributes and selectors:
            <ul>

                <li>font-family - to specify/call the font you want. You can import font by linking to them above your
                    style block. Be sure to remember to declare 'rel' and 'type'. Family names should be in "" if they
                    have spaces</li>
                <li>Class - attribute; we used it before, but we can pile on classes just by using a space in the
                    declaration!</li>
                <li>Attribute Selectors - using this to style elements by using [attribute="value"] as a selector. I did
                    this with my radio buttons to give them a margin.</li>
                <li>border-radius - to create rounded border edges. Giving it a border radius of 50% will create a round
                    image. I used this for banana cat.</li>
                <li>Background-color - used this for my nav section!</li>
                <li>'Value' - attribute; because checkboxes and radio report their values from the 'value' attribute, we
                    should define what it is when the corresponding boxes/buttons are selected. The default would be
                    'on' (used when no value attribute has been assigned), however this won't be useful if we have a
                    long list of buttons as this would appear as 'input-name: on', rather than the id or text the user
                    had selected.</li>
                <li>Checked - attribute; you can use this to 'check' (fill in) by default a radio or checkbox button.
                    I've used this on a couple buttons below - I don't generally like them for surveys, but I'm
                    implementing it below anyway. It has a good use case for things like pre-input/saved user data.</li>
                <li>id - attribute; it's considered best practice to give elements unique id's. They are useful for
                    selecting and modifying specific elements using Javascript. I did this for my short meme survey. We
                    reference id using # rather than a dot operator like classes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Formatting and Overrides</h3>
        <p>
            There was also some general information on formatting and style overrides:
            <ul>
                <li>CSS class declaration in HTML - so I don't think I did this before in my previous workshop, however
                    this is pretty neat. Basically I can create a CSS class and use it in a style block to modify HTML
                    elements. I did this to create an orange heading for this segment.</li>
                <li>Clockwise-notation - I have been doing this almost religiously so I don't have to specify -top,
                    -right, -bottom, -left for margins, borders and well, anything really, by inputting all of my values
                    into a single, say, 'padding' with the values corresponding to the directions going clockwise from
                    top to left. </li>
                <li>Declaration override - If you have competing styles in your class, the second declaration will
                    always take precedence over the first. 'id' attribute, then inline styling will override everything
                    competing with it.</li>
                <li>!important- Makes sure that the specific style is applied and not overridden by other styles for
                    example. I had to use this for my radio button's margins because Bootstrap was interfering.</li>
                <li>Short Hex Codes - It's a thing. Instead of writing #FF0000 for red, you could just write #F00...or
                    red for that matter.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Variables and Root</h3>
        <h4>Variables</h4>
        <p>Variables in CSS are denoted using '--' before the variable name. This would allow you to change
            multiple style properties at once. You can reference your variable using 'var(--variable-name)' as a value
            to a property. You may also assign a <i>Fallback value</i>.This will be displayed if the desired value or
            variable could not be found. Good for debugging or compatibility. This can look like:
            <ul>
                <li>background:var(--variable-name, fallback);</li>
                <li>or simply background:red; if placed the line above the variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Root</h4>
        <!--reword-->
        <p>
            When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it.
            It also is available in any of that selector's descendants. This happens because CSS variables are
            inherited, just like ordinary properties.

            To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element.

            :root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html
            element. By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from
            any other selector in the style sheet.

            Define a variable named --penguin-belly in the :root selector and give it the value of pink. You can then
            see that the variable is inherited and that all the child elements which use it get pink backgrounds.

            When you create your variables in :root they will set the value of that variable for the whole page.

            You can then over-write these variables by setting them again within a specific element.
        </p>
        <h3>Media Queries</h3>
        <!--reword and do it with Root-->
        <p>

            CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

            For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change the
            value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.

            In the :root selector of the media query, change it so --penguin-size is redefined and given a value of
            200px. Also, redefine --penguin-skin and give it a value of black. Then resize the preview to see this
            change in action.
        </p>
        <h2 id="AVD-section">Applied Visual Design</h2>
        <p>This is all about ~design~. It begins with touching base on aligning elements, which I have experience with
            doing, however I thought I may as well write a little about them as I often do get a little confused by the
            different aligns.</p>
        <h3>Align</h3>
        <p>Basically where the element sits on the page. There are a number of align values for text elements using
            text-align. I'm messing around with aligns in the card below:
            <ul>
                <li>justify - Makes sure all lines of text hit the left and right of page except the last line. Makes
                    text look neat.</li>
                <li>center - Middle of page.</li>
                <li>right/left - Self-explanatory.</li>
        </p>
        </ul>
        <div class="wholeCard">
            <div class="cardContent">
                <h3>Animal Crossing</h3>
                <hr>
                <div class="cardText">
                    <p>Enjoy fun times with your pals in your own deserted island. Catch fish and bugs, collect
                        seashells, and gather fruit. Shake trees for branches and hidden goodies, however, be wary
                        of wasps! They will sting!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cardImage">

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy6D3QYnhSk">Animal Crossing theme song</a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We are also learning about new tags which apply CSS when used in HTML. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Strong - using this in your HTML will apply the CSS font-style: bold; to whatever it is wrapped
                    around</li>
                <li>U - underlines what it is wrapped around, applying the CSS text-decoration: underline;</li>
                <li>Em - font-style: italics</li>
                <li>S - text-decoration: line-through</li>
                <li>hr - self-closing; adds a horizontal line to separate elements in HTML4, but in HTML5 it's more like
                    a break</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>A few other things like adding a to rgb --> as in rgba() will allow us to adjust the colour opacity.</p>
        <h3>Box Shadows</h3>
        <p>These add nifty little shadows to an element. Multiple box shadows can be created by using commas to separate
            properties of each box shadow element.This property takes the following values in this order:
            <ul>
                <li>offset-x - how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element</li>
                <li>offset-y - how far to push the shadow vertically from the element</li>
                <li>blur-radius - optional; how blurry the shadow is with 0 = sharp and higher numbers or percentages
                    increase the amount of blur</li>
                <li>spread-radius - optional; size of the shadow. The default is 0 in which the spread-radius is equal
                    to the blur size</li>
                <li>color - shadow color</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Even More Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opacity - This sets the opacity of items. Takes a value of 0-1</li>
            <li>text-transform - Turns case into whatever the value is such as lowercase, uppercase, capitalise, initial
                (default value), inherit (parent value) and none (original text).</li>
            <li>font-weight - Sets how thicc characters are</li>
            <li>line-height - Sets the line height between lines</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors to select for a specific state of the element.
            Pseudo-classes can include:
            <ul>
                <li>hover - this selects for what happens to the element if the mouse is hovering over it. You can
                    observe this in the Animal Crossing card where the link hover is red.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p> We can use this to override the CSS box-model and place items where we would like them. We will be looking
            at the following 4 items:
            <ul>
                <li>Relative - this allows placement of elements in a spot relative to the normal flow in the box model.
                    This uses the CSS offset properties
                    of left or right, and top or bottom to say how far away from the normal position the element will
                    now be.</li>
                <li>Absolute - this locks an element into a position relative to the parent container. This takes the
                    element out of the normal flow of the document making surrounding items ignore it. Basically, it's
                    out here doing its own thing and everyone else is none the wiser. The CSS offset properties are used
                    to adjust the position.</li>
                <p style="background-color: lemonchiffon; font-style: italic; margin:1em">Be careful! Absolute
                    positioning can be problematic. If you don't add a position rule to your parent,
                    your browser will look 'up the chain' to prescribe your 'absolute'. It could result in defaulting to
                    the body tag to receive that info.</p>
                <li>Fixed - a type of absolute position. This locks an element into place relative to the browser window
                    and takes CSS offset properties. Fixed allows you to have something stay in the same position even
                    when you scroll. However, be careful with styling - as it is removed from the normal flow of the
                    document, it can disrupt the aesthetics of the page resulting in the need for layout
                    adjustments/accommodations. It doesn't occupy a 'space' per se and just hangs around on a spot on

                <li>Sticky - a type of relative position similar to fixed. However, it does occupy a space in a
                    container, and acts similar to fixed once it is scrolled past. You can observe this below in my
                    triptych of my favourite animal crossing friends.

                <p>Due to the customisability of position types, we can have overlapping elements where later HTML
                    elements
                    appear on top of earlier ones.
            </div>

                <p>This box is underneath because of a thing called z-index.</p>

        </div> 
    -->

        <p>As mentioned earlier, we may, for aesthetic or functional reasons, want to make
            adjustments to our layout to prevent or reduce overlap. z-index
            allows us to specify the order of how our elements are stacked. This property takes an integer whereby
            elements with higher values will appear at the top than those with lower values.</p>

                <p>"Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good
                    to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be
                    organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments
                    (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content."</p>
