        <h3>New Elements and Attributes</h3>
        <p>While I am revisiting old concepts which may be viewed on my <a href="./index.html">Codecademy: Make A
                Website</a> page, I am also
            introduced to a few new HTML elements, attributes and types. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Anchors - element; finally I can create internal links to different sections of my webpage which can
                    be
                    observed on this page. To do this, I created an anchor using the 'a' element, which the 'href' then
                    takes a # with an 'id' attribute which is assigned to an element I wish to link to. You can also
                    create 'dead links' using just the # symbol, this is useful when modifying the link in Javascript,
                    or as a placeholder if the link is yet unknown. You can also use dead links to turn an image into a
                    clickable link, by nesting the image in the dead anchor.
                </li>
                <li>target="_blank" - this attribute/value coupling can be used to open links in a fresh tab.</li>
                <li>input - a self-closing element that allows me to get input from a user. I can select a type of input
                    accepted by it aswell such as text</li>
                <li>Placeholder - attribute; placeholder text is what sits in the input box before the user has put
                    anything in.</li>
                <li>Form - element; allows you to build webform and submit input data to a server. To do so, use the
                    'action' attribute.</li>
                <li>Button - self-explanatory element; this also takes a 'type' and text.</li>
                <li>Required - attribute; can be given to 'input' so inputs are...well..required to progress in a form
                    for example.</li>
                <li>Label - element; nesting elements within it, will associate them with the label element and can lead
                    to cool things like clickable associated text for radio buttons. In this case, it is always good
                    practice to give your labels a 'for' attribute whose label matches with the input 'id' attribute.
                    Each label in a set should share the same 'name' attribute value in the input element to create a
                    radio group.</li>
                <li>Radio buttons - 'type' value of 'input'. Basically multiple-choice buttons. Below I included ones
                    with and without 'label'.</li>
                <li>Checkboxes - a type of input. It is best practice to match your label 'for' and input 'id' values.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--Make own box example for margins, padding and borders relative to 2 html elements, show that setting a negative margin makes the element larger-->
        <p>We also touch on creating ordered and unordered lists, which I love using. The example on Free Code Camp was
            to create lists on what cats love and hate. I decided to use my favourite image of a cat displaying the
            'hatred' emotion state to utilise the 'dead linking' I mentioned earlier.</p>

        <h2 id="CSS-section" class="orange-text">Basic CSS</h2>
        <p>Again, a lot of this is a refresh of old concepts such as setting fonts, changing colours, padding and
            margins, however there are a few new tricks as well. Here are some new attributes and selectors:
            <ul>

                <li>font-family - to specify/call the font you want. You can import font by linking to them above your
                    style block. Be sure to remember to declare 'rel' and 'type'. Family names should be in "" if they
                    have spaces</li>
                <li>Class - attribute; we used it before, but we can pile on classes just by using a space in the
                    declaration!</li>
                <li>Attribute Selectors - using this to style elements by using [attribute="value"] as a selector. I did
                    this with my radio buttons to give them a margin.</li>
                <li>border-radius - to create rounded border edges. Giving it a border radius of 50% will create a round
                    image. I used this for banana cat.</li>
                <li>Background-color - used this for my nav section!</li>
                <li>'Value' - attribute; because checkboxes and radio report their values from the 'value' attribute, we
                    should define what it is when the corresponding boxes/buttons are selected. The default would be
                    'on' (used when no value attribute has been assigned), however this won't be useful if we have a
                    long list of buttons as this would appear as 'input-name: on', rather than the id or text the user
                    had selected.</li>
                <li>Checked - attribute; you can use this to 'check' (fill in) by default a radio or checkbox button.
                    I've used this on a couple buttons below - I don't generally like them for surveys, but I'm
                    implementing it below anyway. It has a good use case for things like pre-input/saved user data.</li>
                <li>id - attribute; it's considered best practice to give elements unique id's. They are useful for
                    selecting and modifying specific elements using Javascript. I did this for my short meme survey. We
                    reference id using # rather than a dot operator like classes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Formatting and Overrides</h3>
        <p>
            There was also some general information on formatting and style overrides:
            <ul>
                <li>CSS class declaration in HTML - so I don't think I did this before in my previous workshop, however
                    this is pretty neat. Basically I can create a CSS class and use it in a style block to modify HTML
                    elements. I did this to create an orange heading for this segment.</li>
                <li>Clockwise-notation - I have been doing this almost religiously so I don't have to specify -top,
                    -right, -bottom, -left for margins, borders and well, anything really, by inputting all of my values
                    into a single, say, 'padding' with the values corresponding to the directions going clockwise from
                    top to left. </li>
                <li>Declaration override - If you have competing styles in your class, the second declaration will
                    always take precedence over the first. 'id' attribute, then inline styling will override everything
                    competing with it.</li>
                <li>!important- Makes sure that the specific style is applied and not overridden by other styles for
                    example. I had to use this for my radio button's margins because Bootstrap was interfering.</li>
                <li>Short Hex Codes - It's a thing. Instead of writing #FF0000 for red, you could just write #F00...or
                    red for that matter.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Variables and Root</h3>
        <h4>Variables</h4>
        <p>Variables in CSS are denoted using '--' before the variable name. This would allow you to change
            multiple style properties at once. You can reference your variable using 'var(--variable-name)' as a value
            to a property. You may also assign a <i>Fallback value</i>.This will be displayed if the desired value or
            variable could not be found. Good for debugging or compatibility. This can look like:
            <ul>
                <li>background:var(--variable-name, fallback);</li>
                <li>or simply background:red; if placed the line above the variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Root</h4>
        <!--reword-->
        <p>
            When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it.
            It also is available in any of that selector's descendants. This happens because CSS variables are
            inherited, just like ordinary properties.

            To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element.

            :root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html
            element. By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from
            any other selector in the style sheet.

            Define a variable named --penguin-belly in the :root selector and give it the value of pink. You can then
            see that the variable is inherited and that all the child elements which use it get pink backgrounds.

            When you create your variables in :root they will set the value of that variable for the whole page.

            You can then over-write these variables by setting them again within a specific element.
        </p>
        <h3>Media Queries</h3>
        <!--reword and do it with Root-->
        <p>

            CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

            For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change the
            value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.

            In the :root selector of the media query, change it so --penguin-size is redefined and given a value of
            200px. Also, redefine --penguin-skin and give it a value of black. Then resize the preview to see this
            change in action.
        </p>
        <h2 id="AVD-section">Applied Visual Design</h2>
        <p>This is all about ~design~. It begins with touching base on aligning elements, which I have experience with
            doing, however I thought I may as well write a little about them as I often do get a little confused by the
            different aligns.</p>
        <h3>Align</h3>
        <p>Basically where the element sits on the page. There are a number of align values for text elements using
            text-align. I'm messing around with aligns in the card below:
            <ul>
                <li>justify - Makes sure all lines of text hit the left and right of page except the last line. Makes
                    text look neat.</li>
                <li>center - Middle of page.</li>
                <li>right/left - Self-explanatory.</li>
        </p>
        </ul>
        <div class="wholeCard">
            <div class="cardContent">
                <h3>Animal Crossing</h3>
                <hr>
                <div class="cardText">
                    <p>Enjoy fun times with your pals in your own deserted island. Catch fish and bugs, collect
                        seashells, and gather fruit. Shake trees for branches and hidden goodies, however, be wary
                        of wasps! They will sting!</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We are also learning about new tags which apply CSS when used in HTML. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Strong - using this in your HTML will apply the CSS font-style: bold; to whatever it is wrapped
                    around</li>
                <li>U - underlines what it is wrapped around, applying the CSS text-decoration: underline;</li>
                <li>Em - font-style: italics</li>
                <li>S - text-decoration: line-through</li>
                <li>hr - self-closing; adds a horizontal line to separate elements in HTML4, but in HTML5 it's more like
                    a break</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>A few other things like adding a to rgb --> as in rgba() will allow us to adjust the colour opacity.</p>
        <h3>Box Shadows</h3>
        <p>These add nifty little shadows to an element. Multiple box shadows can be created by using commas to separate
            properties of each box shadow element.This property takes the following values in this order:
            <ul>
                <li>offset-x - how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element</li>
                <li>offset-y - how far to push the shadow vertically from the element</li>
                <li>blur-radius - optional; how blurry the shadow is with 0 = sharp and higher numbers or percentages
                    increase the amount of blur</li>
                <li>spread-radius - optional; size of the shadow. The default is 0 in which the spread-radius is equal
                    to the blur size</li>
                <li>color - shadow color</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Even More Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opacity - This sets the opacity of items. Takes a value of 0-1</li>
            <li>text-transform - Turns case into whatever the value is such as lowercase, uppercase, capitalise, initial
                (default value), inherit (parent value) and none (original text).</li>
            <li>font-weight - Sets how thicc characters are</li>
            <li>line-height - Sets the line height between lines</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors to select for a specific state of the element.
            Pseudo-classes can include:
            <ul>
                <li>hover - this selects for what happens to the element if the mouse is hovering over it. You can
                    observe this in the Animal Crossing card where the link hover is red.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p> We can use this to override the CSS box-model and place items where we would like them. We will be looking
            at the following 4 items:
            <ul>
                <li>Relative - this allows placement of elements in a spot relative to the normal flow in the box model.
                    This uses the CSS offset properties
                    of left or right, and top or bottom to say how far away from the normal position the element will
                    now be.</li>
                <li>Absolute - this locks an element into a position relative to the parent container. This takes the
                    element out of the normal flow of the document making surrounding items ignore it. Basically, it's
                    out here doing its own thing and everyone else is none the wiser. The CSS offset properties are used
                    to adjust the position.</li>
                <p style="background-color: lemonchiffon; font-style: italic; margin:1em">Be careful! Absolute
                    positioning can be problematic. If you don't add a position rule to your parent,
                    your browser will look 'up the chain' to prescribe your 'absolute'. It could result in defaulting to
                    the body tag to receive that info.</p>
                <li>Fixed - a type of absolute position. This locks an element into place relative to the browser window
                    and takes CSS offset properties. Fixed allows you to have something stay in the same position even
                    when you scroll. However, be careful with styling - as it is removed from the normal flow of the
                    document, it can disrupt the aesthetics of the page resulting in the need for layout
                    adjustments/accommodations. It doesn't occupy a 'space' per se and just hangs around on a spot on
                    the viewport - like a fly on your screen.</li>
                <li>Sticky - a type of relative position similar to fixed. However, it does occupy a space in a
                    container, and acts similar to fixed once it is scrolled past a defined position for it. You can
                    observe this below in my
                    triptych of my favourite animal crossing friends.

        <h2>Colour Theory</h2>
        <p>I have a background in art and am an avid painter. So colour theory is something I have a lot of experience
            with, but it doesn't mean it is easier for me. I can spend hours just choosing the right colours most times,
            but the pay off is significant. For a thesis project - having the appropriate colours for my presentation
            not only helped to explain my project, but also improved the professional look of my poster. It helped to
            significantly increase engagement with my project relative to my peers. All this is telling you is that
            colour and design really matters!</p>
        <p>A good grasp of colour theory will really help your projects pop. So far, I've gone
            for very neutral colours that have stayed within the same colour family as this is a journal. However,
            there may be some instances where I would need to really play with colour theory to evoke different
            emotions,make elements eye-catching and influence the overall general feel of my project. In keeping within
            the same colour family, I've helped my journal look clean, unfussy and organised, but it's not going to help
            me win any prizes.

            Useful tools include the colour-wheel, checking out Pantone layouts and drawing inspiration from
            source material related to your project. But let's first talk about the colour wheel.
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="https://st.depositphotos.com/1012407/2179/v/450/depositphotos_21796649-stock-illustration-color-wheel.jpg">
            <ul>
                <li>Colours on the opposite sides of the wheel are complementary. These are great for creating high
                    contrast and making elements stand-out from each other. Artist Takashi Murakami uses complementary
                    colours a lot in his art to make his works vibrant. Mixing complementary colours will create a gray.
                </li>
                <li>Neighbouring colours are different hues from a similar source - you can think of these colours as
                    belonging to the same family. For example the colours to the left and right of red are shades of red
                    with more yellow (clockwise) and more magenta/blue (anti-clockwise) pigment. Using these colours
                    together ensures harmony as you are selecting colours within the same family.</li>
                <li>Adding varying levels of white to a colour produces lighter tints of the same colour.</li>
                <li>Adding varying levels to a colour produces darker shades of the same colour.</li>
                <li>Adding warm tones (red/yellow/orange) to a colour will create a warmer toned version of the colour.
                </li>
                <li>Adding cool tones (magenta/blue/green) to a colour will create a cooler toned version of the colour.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Modern colour theory follows the additive RGB model which is used in digital devices, and the subtractive
            CMY(K) model which is predominantly used in printing. To help you with choosing colours, you can use a
            colour picking tool. The example below examines the basic principles of colour theory using red.

            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Tertiary Colours</h3>
        <p>In the RGB model, the primary colours are red, green and blue. Mixing two primary colours results in
            secondary colours. And mixing a primary colour with a secondary colour results in a tertiary colour. As
            shown below, mixing blue and green creates cyan, blue and red creates magenta, and red and green creates
            yellow. Seconary colours are also complementary or contrasting colours to the colour they do not contain -
            for example cyan complements red as blue and green create cyan, and not red.</p>

        <p>Although contrast is great for impact, too many contrasting colours can be overwhelming. Putting text on a
            contrasting colour can make it annoying to read as well. Thus it is best to use just one contrasting colour
            and delegate it towards creating visual impact for an element you wish to highlight.</p>

        <div class="boxColour">
            <section class="container">
                <div class="row">

            <div class="boxSpringGreen"></div>
            <div class="boxChartreuse"></div>
        </div>

        <p>This exercise goes further into looking at Hue, Saturation, Tone and Lightness and manipulating these values
            with'hsl()' which takes a numerical value for the colour, the % saturation and the %lightness. I won't go
            over
            that here as I am comfortable in this topic. However, for more on colour theory,
            Canva has a great resource which you can find <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Gradients</h3>
        <p>Using the 'background' properties 'linear-gradient()' function, we can create gradients in any direction,
            with any and as many colours as we would like. This function takes a direction value using degrees from 0 to
            360.</p>
        <div class="roundGradient">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Below I used a new function called 'repeating-linear-gradient()', which will allow us to make a repeating
            pattern out of our gradient. To do this, we need to indicate where our colours will transition from one to
            the other. This stopping point can be marked either with a % or px.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="roundRepeat">
        </div>
        <br>

        <h4>Transform</h4>
        <p>'Transform' can be used with a variety of functions to manipulate elements:
            <ul>
                <li>'scale()' - Increase or decrease the size of things. Basically scaling up or down. I've used this to
                    increase the size of my first gradient when hovering.</li>
                <li>'skew()' - Can be 'skewX()' and/or 'skewY()'. This skews the image along the X and/or Y axis. This
                    can be observed on my second gradient.</li>
                <li>'rotate' - Self-explanatory.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Graphics and Animation</h3>
        <p>At this point, I have made quite a few of my own graphics, particularly in the Colour Theory section. Below
            I've created an overlapping graphic using the skills I have learned so far to make my moon. I have made the
            overlapping element slightly lighter than the background so you can see how I made the crescent moon shape.
        </p>

        <div class="boxSolid">
            <div class="moonRound">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>When creating more complex shapes, the following properties and pseudo-elements may become useful:
            <ul>
                <li>'content' - Property; necessary when using the '::before' and '::after' pseudo-classes where
                    'content' is set to an empty string. 'content' is also used to add photos, text and other items to a
                    selected element. </li>
                <li>'::before' and '::after' - Pseudo-class; these are used to add something before or after a selected
                    element.</li>
            </ul>
            In the exercise, this was used to create a graphic of a heart. Because I am currently not feeling very
            creative, I am just going to include the heart I made in the exercise here. I have also added some animation
            to it, which is covered in the section below.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="heart">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>@keyframes and Animation</h4>
        <p>For this segment, we are introduced to a number of properties and @keyframes. @keyframes is a rule which
            controls what happens in each frame of the animation, whereas the properties control how the animation
            should behave.
            These properties include: <ul>
                <li>'animation-name' - sets the animation's name</li>
                <li>'animation-duration' - sets the length of the animation</li>
                <li>'animation-timing-function' - specifies how the animation accelerates and decelerates over the
                    course of the duration. Values include 'ease', which is the default, 'linear', 'ease-in' and
                    'ease-out'. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="wholeCard">
            <div class="cardText">
                <p>"@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is
                    done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging
                    from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element
                    displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end,
                    right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given
                    duration to act out the scene."</p>
                <h5>- Free Code Camp, 2020</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Below I have created a bar which fades from a minty colour into the webpage by using the opacity property in
            @keyframes.</p>
        <div class="boxFade" id="boxMint">
        </div>
        <p>And below I used @keyframes to change a button's hover state. The second button includes a new piece of info,
            'animation-fill-mode'. This property specifies what styling to use when the animation has finished. Setting
            it to 'forwards' as a value, allows it to stay orange. In my
            first one, it defaulted to the in-built Bootstrap hover state.</p>
        <div class="buttonAnimated">
            <button>Animated Hover State</button>

            <button id="buttonNew">New Animated Hover State</button>
        </div>

        <p>Additionally, CSS offset properties can be used to move items around if the element has its position set to
            either 'relative', 'fixed' or 'absolute'. Check out my bouncy ball!</p>
        <div style="height: 200px">
            <div class="bouncyBall">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>To keep this ball bouncing, and to keep my heart from earlier still beating, I used the
            'animation-iteration-count: infinite' property and value.</p>

        <h4>Cubic Bezier</h4>
        <p>Oh boy. This confused me a lot - it all came out as a massive info-dump which for a beginner is a lot to take
            in. </p>
        <!--
        <p>Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation
            plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the
            duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

            The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0
            and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the
            origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in
            the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x
            and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's
            an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

            animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);

            In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2),
            which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1).
            This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using
            the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.
            
            

            A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first
            and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword
            (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation
            progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

            In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which
            controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to
            mimic the ease-out style:

            animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);

            Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example,
            the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of
            1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change
            in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end
            of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1
            (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to
            the animation duration.

            This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered
        the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need
        to customize a Bezier curve for this.

        The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to
        infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two
        identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

        The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

        cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);

        Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate
        system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This
        results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.

        <h2 id="Accessibility-section">Applied Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Ensuring that your site is able to be experienced by those with low vision or who use screen-readers is
            important. Basically, assistive technologies can analyse a webpage for specific tags as the reader may set
            the reader to scan for specific areas to jump to and read areas which are then relevant for them. For
            example, the reader may be set to only read main headings like 'h1', thus if you don't use that in your
            code, your headings won't be read. This is referred to as 'semantic meaning' - making your code semantically
            meaningful is really useful for making your page accessible. One of the examples was that a description of
            an image used as a page break
            should not be included in 'alt'. And although HTML5 treats these tags no different to a div, they provide a
            lot of semantic information to assistive technologies that can optimise their user's experience of your
            site. Here are a few more tags that are helpful
            for those who use screen readers:
            <ul>
                <li>'main' - This wraps around the main content of your page and does not include elements that repeat
                    across the site like headers, navs and footers. This tag gives assistive tech the ability to 'jump
                    to main' for example.</li>
                <li>'article' - Groups independent, self-contained content. Wraps around independent sections of content
                    such as blog entries, forum posts or news
                    articles. To determine what fits together, ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context,
                    would that content still make sense?</li>
                <li>'section' - Groups related content. Wraps around thematically related content rather than
                    independent content, like a
                    chapter to a book.</li>
                <li>'div' - Groups content. Use this for content where there is no relationship between it and other
                    groups. There is no
                    point in sectioning it into a section or article basically.</li>
                <li>'nav' - Wraps around the main navigation links of the page. If there are recurring links acrossing
                    pages, just stick them in a header or footer. Nav is more for page navigation, not site-wide
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>'figure' - Wraps around a figure (i.e image, chart, diagram etc). This is paired with 'figcaption'
                    internally.</li>
                <li>'figcaption - Goes with 'figure' and replaces the 'p' element. It is for captioning the figure.</li>
                <li>'label' - Wraps around the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a
                    choice. Previously we used 'label' for radio buttons where we wrapped the radio button input element
                    inside a label element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to
                    achieve this is by using the for attribute as explained in this lesson. The value of the for
                    attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control. </li>
                <li>'fieldset' - Wraps around a group of radio buttons which are possible answers to one question. It
                    also uses a 'legend' tag which describes the grouping - basically replaces the 'p' tag/what is used
                    to express the question. 'fieldset' and 'legend' aren't necessary if the choices are
                    self-explanatory like in gender selection.</li>
                <li>'input' - Used to provide form controls for a variety of input types. You can specify these types
                    using the 'type' attribute - types may include 'submit', 'date' and 'text' - all fairly
                    self-explanatory. 'text' is the default type. Don't forget to 'name' your input!</li>
                <li>'time' and 'datetime' attribute - This element + attribute pairing can wrap around text that allows
                    us to express and produce the more specific and non-colloquial version of it to avoid confusion
                    inline for screenreader users.</li>
                <li>'accesskey' - Lets you assign a keyboard shortcut key to an element which when hit will allow you to
                    activate or focus on the element. This is case sensitive.</li>
                <li>'tabindex' - Lets someone tab to an element. The value (positive, negative and 0) determines the
                    behaviour. You can use the CSS pseudo-class ':focus' with it. You can use 'tabindex' to cycle
                    through the order of tabbing using the value, the lowest number from 1 being first. 'tabindex'
                    will be explored further later on. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Aside from tagging your page, there are other considerations to be made. Such as how are you going to have
            screenreaders read a chart or diagram? Well you are better off using a table for them, but what if you
            really want that graph and not both? Well you can hide the table from non-screenreader using users by
            playing with CSS by setting 'position:absolute', width/height to 1px and left to -10000px.</p>

                The following do not work, despite what people online may say:
                <ul>
                    <li>display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users
                    </li>
                    <li> Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the
                        flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Other good ideas from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines</a> include:
            <ul>
                <li>High contrast text - Recommended to be at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. This
                    ratio is calculated by comparing the luminance values of two colours which can range from 1:1 = same
                    colour/no contrast, to 21:1 which = white vs black/the most contrast. You can use online tools to
                    check for contrast ratios.</li>
                <li>Avoid colourblindness - You can counteract the muddy/blurring greyscale from colourblindness by
                    ensuring you have strong enough contrast. A 4.5:1 is advised - this can be done by shading the
                    darker colour and tinting the lighter colour.</li>
                <li>Choose the right colours - Maybe don't choose colours too close to each other on the colour wheel in
                    the same space or as a foreground vs background colour. Use a colour calculator or colour simulator
                    if you are having trouble.</li>

        <h2 id="ResponsivePrinciples-section">Responsive Web Design Principles</h2>
        <p><em>"Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of
                different
                devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences. In
                general,
                design the page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile
                users,
                take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes."</em> - Free Code
            Camp, 2020.
            I could not have said it better myself.</p>
        <h3>Media Queries</h3>
        <p>Media queries basically adjusts content to fit into the viewport. The viewport is essentially the dimensions
            of visible page space the user can see, which is dependent upon the device they are using. Media queries use
            a media-type, which if it matches with the device the page is displayed on, the relevant styles will be
            applied. A media query takes max or min height or width. They may look like this:

            <div class="wholeCard">
                <p>
                    @media (max-height: 400px) { <br>
                    h4 {<br>
                    font-size: 12px;<br>
                    }<br>
                    }<br></p>
            </div>
            This media query basically says, that for viewports with a maximum height of 400px, make the h4 header have
            a font-size of 12px.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
        <p>Making responsive images is much easier. Just add max-width: 100% and height: auto to your img CSS. Check out
            the example below:
            <img src=>
            <img style="max-width: 100% height:auto" src=>
        </p>
        <h3>Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays</h3>
        <p>Pixel density, which can impact how high resolution your page is displayed, can vary between devices. Pixel
            density is evaluated as Pixel Per Inch (PPI) or Dots Per Inch (DPI)
            Retina Displau, used in Macs, are a form of high resolution display. They have different pixel density to
            Non-Retina displays which often have lower resolution. Images not made with high-DPI/high-resolution in mind
            will end up looking pixelated. But we can fix that by defining an image's width and height values as half
            (or smaller) than in the original file. For example, if your image you ripped off Google Images has a width
            of 400 and height of 600, reduce the width to 200 and height to 300 or 50%.
            <h3>Typography Responsive</h3>
            <p>We have been using px and em to size our text and elements for that matter, but we can also use 'viewport
                units' which function similarly to percentages in that they are relative units, but of course are
                different. <em>"Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device,
                    whereas
                    percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element."</em> - Free Code Camp, 2020

                The four viewport dimensions include:
                <ul>
                    <li> vw (viewport width): 15vw would be 15% of the viewport's width. </li>
                    <li>vh (viewport height): 40vh would be 40% of the viewport's height.</li>
                    <li>vmin (viewport minimum): 9vmin would be 9% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or
                        width).</li>
                    <li>vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or
                        width).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Flexbox-section">CSS Flexbox</h2>
            <p>CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode
                that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. While somewhat new,
                all popular modern browsers support flexbox. This section covers how to use flexbox and the different
                layout options it offers.</p>

            <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg"
                alt="image showing flexbox axis and container start and end points">

            <p> Here are a few new flexbox options:
                <ul>
                    <li>'flexdirection' - Takes 'row', 'column', 'row-reverse' and 'column-reverse' as values.</li>
                    <li>'justify-content' - Aligns items along the main axis.(REWORD THIS LESSON HERE)</li>
                    <li>'align-items' - Aligns items on the cross axis.(REWORD LESSON HERE)</li>
                    <li>'flex-wrap' - Fit items into the same row and move extra items to a new row. This takes 'nowrap'
                        (default), 'wrap' and 'reverse wrap'.</li>
                    <li>'flex-shrink' - Causes an item to shrink in the container if the container is too small to fit
                        them all. The numerical value it takes denotes by how many times the item can shrink.</li>
                    <li>'flex-grow' - The inverse of 'flex-shrink'</li>
                    <li>'flex-basis' - Specifies initial size of the item before flex-shrink/grow adjustments. It takes
                        all size properties, auto lets it size the item based on its content size.</li>
                    <li>'flex' - Property. Uses clockwise notation to take values for 'flex-shrink', 'flex-grow' and
                        lastly, 'flex-basis'.</li>
                    <li>'order' - Property. Denotes the order from left-right/top-down the flex items appear.</li>
                    <li>'align-self' - Property. Allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually, instead of
                        setting them all at once. Takes the same values as 'align-items' and will also override it. This
                        is a good work around for other common adjustment techniques using the CSS properties float,
                        clear, and vertical-align which do not work on flex items.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="CSSGrid-section">CSS Grid</h2>
            <p>
                The CSS grid allows you to design web pages easily and more simply. Basically, it turns an HTML element
                into a grid with rows and columns which you can then use to place child elements into exactly where you
                want them to be in this grid. The grid is made up of lines with the top line valued as line '1' and and
                the edge of its row or column begins line '2'. This image may help explain the grid better:
                <br>

                <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/grid_lines.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some useful grid tools:
                <ul>
                    <li>'display:grid' - Establishes your grid within the element you put this in. You can also create a
                        grid within a grid by using this on an item of your main grid.</li>
                    <li>'grid-template-columns'/'grid-template-rows' - Adds columns/rows to your grid.</li>
                    <li>'fr' - This value sets the column or row to be a fraction of the available space</li>
                    <li>'auto' - This value sets the column or row to the width/height of its content automatically</li>
                    <li>'%' - Adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container</li>
                    <li>'grid-column-gap' - Places a gap between the columns. According to VS code, this is now
                        obsolete, however it still works for me on Firefox as of <time
                            datetime="2020/05/03">3/5/2020</time>.</li>
                    <li>'grid-row-gap' - Places a gap between rows</li>
                    <li>'grid-gap' - Short-form for previous 2. Takes up to 2 values where the first value is taken for
                        rows, and the second is for columns.</li>
                    <li>'grid-column'/'grid-row' - Allows us to specify how many columns/rows an item will consume in
                        the grid. If
                        written as 'grid-columm: 1/2', the item will fill the first column as it starts at line one and
                        ends at line two. </li>
                    <li>'justify-self' - Align the content's position within its cell (box) horizontally. By default
                        this is set to 'stretch' which makes the item fill the cell. Other values include 'start'
                        (aligns left), 'center' and 'end' (aligns right). You can use this in your parent container to
                        set the alignment for all items, or individually. </li>
                    <li>'align-self'- Aligns the item within its cell vertically. Takes the same values as
                        'justify-self'.</li>
                </ul>

                In the example above, box 1 is set to auto, 2 is set to 2fr, 3 is set to 30px, 4 is set to 60% and 5 is
                set to 1fr. We have also added a 5px gap between each column and row using 'grid-gap'.
                'grid-template-columns' is used to create
                the columns' width and 'grid-template-rows' to create the rows' height.

            <h4>Grid Area</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>'grid-template-areas' - Allows you to group cells of your grid together into an area and give
                        the area a custom name. Every word in the code represents a cell and every pair of quotation
                        marks represent a row. In addition to custom labels, you can use a period (.) to designate an
                        empty cell in the grid.</li>
                    <!--create example-->
                    <li>'grid-area' - Once you've made your area template, use this to assign the name to your item. Or
                        you can use this with line designation which will look like: 'grid-area: 1/2/3/4' - this
                        translates to 'The item will now sit in the space starting at horizontal line 1 to horizontal
                        line 3, and starting at vertical line 2 and ending at vertical line 4'.</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Repeat</h4>
            <p>
                Additionally, to create this many columns and rows without having to provide size values for all of them
                using the 'grid-template-columns' and 'grid-template-rows', you can use
                'grid-template-columns'/'grid-template-rows' with the attribute 'repeat' followed by in parentheses your
                preferred number of columns/rows followed by another value still in these parentheses to indicate the
                size. This will look like: 'grid-template-columns: repeat(20, 30px);'. This means the grid will have 20
                columns all at 30px in width. You can also put multiple values as shown below:
                <!--EXAMPLE WITH 5 EVEN ROWS, AND 4 EVEN vs 1 EXTRA DIFFERENT ROW-->

                You can also use 'grid-template-columns'/'grid-template-rows' with 'minmax' which will limit the size of
                items when the grid container changes size. It would look something like this 'grid-template-columns:
                repeat(3, minmax(90px, 1fr))'.

                Further interesting things include:
                <ul>
                    <li>'auto-fill' - This allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired
                        size as possible depending on the
                        size of the container. You can create flexible layouts when combining auto-fill with minmax.
                    </li>
                    <li>'auto-fit' - Similar to 'auto-fill' except that 'auto-fill' will keep adding rows/columns to
                        fill the container even if items don't fill it up. 'auto-fit' makes them stretch to fit the
                        remainder of the container.</li>

                </ul>
