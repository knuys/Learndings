            <h3>What is Untitled Goose Game?</h3>
            <p>Untitled Goose Game is a cute video game about a goose. More precisely, it's a video game where you - the
                player - play as the goose. He's charming, he's fluffly, but most importantly, he honks and flaps his
                wings.</p>
            <p>The gameplay is simple - walk around and explore a quaint and peaceful British village whilst being a
                horrible, chaotic goose. Steal hats, hide keys, unearth garden vegetables, lock a storeowner in their
                garage, put someone's slippers into a pond, have a picnic and enhance your bell collection. There is a
                lot of silly, yet adorable fun to be had in this game where the only objective is to annoy the town's
                folk as much as you can and to cause mischief everywhere you go. It's quirky, it's cute, it's fun, but
                above all it's a game about being a horrible goose. </p>
